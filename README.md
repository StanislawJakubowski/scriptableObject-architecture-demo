# Unity Architecture sample;

Sample project architecture showing the possibilities of loading scenes using Addressables and AssetBundles.
Additionally, it shows the possibilities of using ScriptableObjects named here Event Channels to create links between scenes. 
Such use of SO allows to avoid dependency to each other. Scenes are created as blank slates.
This way it's clean and easy to debug.

I was inspired by Unity Open Project # 1: Chop Chop
